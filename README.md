🛒 E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

📘 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing an E-Commerce dataset to extract meaningful insights about sales performance, customer behavior, and future trends.
We went through the complete Data Analysis Pipeline  from raw data in CSV files to visualization and forecasting.

⚙️ Project Workflow

1. Data Collection & Preparation

We started with multiple CSV files containing e-commerce data (such as orders, products, and customers).
These files were loaded into MySQL to ensure efficient querying and data management.
Proper data cleaning and relationship setup were done to maintain referential integrity between tables.
Some relationship parts (LK connections) were handled using Python scripts for better flexibility in data linking and merging.

2. SQL Analysis

Wrote multiple SQL queries to extract important metrics and insights such as:
Top-selling products and categories
Customer purchasing behavior
Monthly and yearly sales trends
Conversion rates and order distribution
The SQL queries helped us understand the data before visualization and detect performance gaps.

3. Power BI Dashboard

The results from SQL were imported into Power BI.
Created a dynamic dashboard showing:
📈 Sales trends over time
🏆 Top-performing products
👥 Customer segmentation
🌍 Regional performance
💰 Revenue and profit KPIs
Added interactive filters and slicers to allow deeper exploration of data.
The dashboard provided clear visibility into business performance and key sales indicators.

4. Forecasting by Python

For the forecasting part, we used Python (Base environment) to predict future sales using historical data.
Implemented time-series forecasting techniques to estimate upcoming revenue trends and seasonal demand.
This step provided valuable insights for future planning and business strategy.

🎯 Key Insights

Identified the most profitable product categories.
Observed strong seasonal patterns in sales data.
Forecasting model showed consistent growth in key months.
Customer behavior analysis revealed retention opportunities.
